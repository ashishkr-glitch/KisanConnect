INTRODUCTION IN DETAIL - KISANCONNECT PROJECT

1. PROJECT OVERVIEW

KisanConnect is a web-based agricultural decision support system designed to empower Indian farmers with real-time information, predictive analytics, personalized advice, and market insights. The platform bridges the gap between modern technology and traditional farming practices by providing data-driven recommendations tailored to each farmer's specific crop, location, and environmental conditions.

The application serves three main user roles:
- Farmers: Access weather data, crop recommendations, pest/disease alerts, and AI-powered agricultural advice.
- Agricultural Experts: Provide verified guidance, monitor farmer queries, and curate best practices.
- Administrators: Manage users, crops, manifests, system configuration, and generate reports.

2. CONTEXT & MOTIVATION

Agricultural Challenges in India:
- Over 80% of India's farming population consists of small and marginal farmers with limited access to modern farming technologies.
- Farmers often lack timely access to accurate weather information, leading to crop damage and reduced yields.
- Post-harvest losses are significant (20-40%) due to poor storage, transportation, and market information.
- Limited knowledge of pest management, disease prevention, and soil health management.
- Difficulty in accessing fair prices for agricultural products due to information asymmetry between farmers and market agents.
- High dependency on intermediaries, resulting in reduced profit margins for farmers.

Technology Gap:
- Most existing agricultural apps are either too complex or lack localized, actionable advice.
- Few platforms integrate real-time weather, market data, and AI-powered recommendations in one place.
- Limited adoption of technology by farmers due to language barriers, digital literacy, and poor connectivity in rural areas.

Motivation for KisanConnect:
- Democratize access to agricultural knowledge and technology for all farmers, regardless of scale or income.
- Reduce post-harvest losses through better planning and market intelligence.
- Enable farmers to make informed decisions about crop selection, planting time, pest management, and harvesting.
- Improve farm profitability by connecting farmers directly with buyers and reducing middlemen.
- Support sustainable farming through data-driven practices and environmental considerations.

3. PROJECT SCOPE
