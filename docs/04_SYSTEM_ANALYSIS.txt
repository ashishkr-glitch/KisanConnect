SYSTEM ANALYSIS - KISANCONNECT PROJECT

1. EXISTING SYSTEM ANALYSIS

1.1 Current State of Agricultural Technology

Traditional Farming Approach:
- Farmers rely on personal experience, local knowledge, and advice from neighbors/traders.
- Decision-making based on seasonal patterns and historical practices.
- Limited integration with scientific knowledge and modern techniques.
- No systematic approach to planning or tracking farm operations.

Current Information Sources:
- Television weather broadcasts (non-localized, often delayed).
- Word-of-mouth and local community knowledge.
- Agricultural input dealers (seeds, fertilizers) who may provide biased advice.
- Newspaper and radio (limited penetration and relevance).
- Government extension workers (overloaded, limited availability).
- Agricultural cooperatives and farmer groups (limited geographic reach).

Challenges with Current Systems:
- Information is generic, not tailored to specific context.
- Significant delay between information and action (weather forecast to farmer decision).
- Lack of integrated information (weather + pest + market + expert advice in one place).
- No systematic decision support tools or tracking mechanisms.
- Limited expert access for small farmers.

1.2 Existing Digital Agricultural Platforms (Benchmarking)

Government Platforms:
- e-NAM (e-National Agricultural Market): Electronic marketplace for agricultural commodities.
  Strengths: Government backing, large scale, price transparency.
  Limitations: Complex interface, limited farmer adoption, focused only on marketing.
- mKisan: SMS-based agricultural information service.
  Strengths: Low-bandwidth, reaches all farmers with SMS capability.
  Limitations: Limited information depth, not interactive, outdated content.
- PMFBY (Pradhan Mantri Fasal Bima Yojana) Portal: Crop insurance scheme.
  Strengths: Financial protection for farmers.
  Limitations: Bureaucratic, focused on insurance not decision support.

Private Platforms:
- Ninjacart, Farmers' Friend, AgroStar: Various agricompanies with farmer-facing apps.
  Strengths: User-friendly interfaces, integrated services, commercial efficiency.
  Limitations: Often focused on selling inputs, small farmer penetration, proprietary data.

Limitations of Current Systems:
- Fragmented (each platform addresses one aspect).
- Complex interfaces not suitable for low-digital-literacy users.
- Limited offline capability.
- Inconsistent information quality.
- Poor integration with each other.
